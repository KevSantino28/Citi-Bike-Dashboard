# Citi-Bike-Dashboard

Posting my Analysis for the project underneath;

The first phenomenon noticed was how much more the bikes were used by commuters compared to leisure rides. 48% of rides were started during the hours of 7, 8, 9 AM and 4, 5, 6, 7 PM. Going into this project I was expecting to see more rides on the outskirts of the city along the riverbanks and alongside central park. Based on the Start Stations by Use Map most trips were started in Mid-Town where most apartments and businesses are.

If presenting this in front of shareholders, I would recommend scaling back on the number of citi bikeâ€™s locations outside of NYC. Looking at the Top 50 Starting Stations Map I created they are all located in Mid-Town around the Flatiron District and just south of Central Park. When viewing the 50 least used Starting locations they mainly reside in Staten Island or North of the city up in Fordham.
